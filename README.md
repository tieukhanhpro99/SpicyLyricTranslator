## Features

- Two display modes

  - LibreTranslate
  - DeepL (API key)
  - OpenAI (API key, configurable model)
  - Gemini (API key)
  - Custom LibreTranslate-compatible endpoint (optional API key)
- Smart language detection that skips translation when lyrics are already in the target language
- Track-aware caching for faster reloads and better offline behavior

- Native Spotify settings integration plus a quick popup via right-click on the translate button
- Keyboard shortcut: `Alt+T` to toggle translation on/off

## Vocabulary / Learning Mode

- Transforms lyric lines into word-by-word paired flashcards
- Original words are blurred by default and revealed on hover, paired with their translated counterpart

## Troubleshooting

- No translate button appears: make sure Spicy Lyrics is installed and the lyrics view is open
- No translations: verify internet access and your selected API; try switching providers
- Wrong language or stale lines: clear the cache from settings and retry
- Extension not loading after manual install: re-run `spicetify apply` and restart Spotify
- Custom API issues: the endpoint must be LibreTranslate-compatible
