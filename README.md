## Highlights

- **Two display modes** — replace the original lines, or keep them and add translations underneath
- **Eight providers** — Google (no key needed), LibreTranslate, DeepL, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Claude, or your own endpoint
- **Romanization-safe** — pulls original lyric text rather than translating romaji, pinyin, or other romanized display text
- **Smart language detection** — skips translation when lyrics are already in your target language
- **Vocabulary / Learning Mode** — word-by-word flashcards, synced to the karaoke highlight
- **Fast on repeats** — track-aware caching, plus 1–6 parallel requests on LLM providers
- **`Alt+T`** to toggle, auto-translate on song change, and a built-in update checker
